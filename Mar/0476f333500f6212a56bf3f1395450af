Today 28th March 2021 marks the 34th anniversary of the launch of SAYCO (South Africa Youth Congress). We salute the death-defying generation of the Young Lions which heeded the call by Comrade President Oliver Tambo to render the country ungovernable and apartheid unworkable. https://t.co/q0mMqxF5sb
