"Whilst you may want to argue that I'm unequivocal, I'm a party animal, because I am a President of the ANC, but I do open a window to look at issues of conscience that drive particular individuals to want to buck the trend or go against party line." ANC President @CyrilRamaphosa https://t.co/Veyq5u5jMG
