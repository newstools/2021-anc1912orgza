@MYANC learned with shock of the passing of its National Executive Committee Jackson "Mvelase" Mthembu, after a battle with COVID 19. We dip our revolutionary banner to this formidable South African patriot. Hamba Kahle Mvelase, Lala ngoxolo Freedom Fighter. #RIPJacksonMthembu https://t.co/RUgF9w3uUh
